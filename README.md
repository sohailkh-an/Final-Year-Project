# Decentralized Freelance Marketplace

The Decentralized Freelance Marketplace is a blockchain-based platform that connects freelancers and clients in a secure, transparent, and decentralized environment. By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized storage, the marketplace aims to address the limitations of traditional freelance platforms, such as high fees, lack of control over user data, and centralized decision-making.

## Features

- Secure and transparent transactions through blockchain technology
- Smart contract-based project management, escrow services, and payment processing
- Decentralized storage for user data and project files
- Token-based economy for transactions and incentives
- Decentralized identity and reputation management system

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
